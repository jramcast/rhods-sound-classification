# Sound Classification Demo with Red Hat OpenShift Data Science

This demo uses Red Hat OpenShift Data Science (RHODS) to train and deploy a model that classifies sounds.
Sounds are classified into categories such as `dog`.

* Hybrid model deployment approach:
  * RHODS model serving: inference is performed in a cluster. Applications such as web front ends can send requests to this model.
  * Embedded model serving: the model can be deployed to devices such as RPI, to perform inference at the edge.
