== Sound Classification Demo with Red{nbsp}Hat OpenShift Data Science

This demo uses Red{nbsp}Hat OpenShift Data Science (RHODS) to train and deploy a machine learning model that classifies sounds.
Sounds are classified into categories such as `dog`.

You will deploy the model in two ways:

RHODS Model Serving::
Inference is performed in the cluster.
Applications such as web front ends can send inference requests to this model via HTTP.

Embedded in a Container Image::
Inference is performed at the edge.
The model is embedded in a container image, as a CLI application.
The container image can be therefore deployed to any environment with a container runtime.

The following diagram illustrates the general flow of this exercise:

+
Inspect the notebook.

b. Analyze the data.
+
Double-click the `1-analysis.ipynb` notebook.
In the top navigation bar, click menu:Run[Run All Cells].
+
Inspect the notebook.

c. Train the model.
+
Double-click the `2-training.ipynb` notebook.
In the top navigation bar, click menu:Run[Run All Cells].
+
Note that the last cell of this notebook uploads the trained model, which is stored in the `sound_classifier.onnx` file, to the root directory of your S3 storage bucket.




7. *Deploy the model with the RHODS model server.*

a. Return to the RHODS data science project browser tab.

b. In the `ovms` model server, click btn:[Deploy Model].
+
image::./assets/deploy-model-btn.png[width=80%,align="center"]

c. Complete the form with the following values.
+
[cols="1,1"]
|===
|*Model Name*
|`sound_classifier`

|*Model framework*
|`onnx - 1`

|*Existing data connection* - Name
|`model-storage-data-connection`

|*Existing data connection* - Folder path
|`sound_classifier.onnx`
|===
+
The data connection configuration values allow RHODS to download the `sound_classifier.onnx` model file from S3 and use it to serve the model with the OpenVINO model sever.

d. Click btn:[Deploy].
Wait until the model status is ready.

e. Return to the browser tab where Jupyter is running and refresh the tab.

f. Double-click the `3-test.ipynb` notebook.
In the top navigation bar, click menu:Run[Run All Cells].
+
Note that the notebook tests the same model by using two approaches:
+
  * The first test uses the `sound_classifier.onnx` local file that contains the trained model.
  * The second test verifies the model deployed with RHODS Model Serving, by sending an HTTP request to the inference endpoint.

g. Verify that the notebook displays the estimated class both by using the local model and the deployed model.





9. *Create a pipeline to deploy the model embedded in a CLI*
+
Build a container image for a CLI that includes the model.
This container image embeds the model, so you can use this application to perform inference at the edge.

a. In the Red{nbsp}Hat OpenShift web console, select the btn:[Developer] perspective, and click btn:[Secrets], then click menu:Create[Key/value secret].
+
The pipeline requires this secret to download the model from S3 and include it in the container image.

b. Enter `s3-model-storage` as the btn:[Secret name].
+
[NOTE]
====
If you use a different name, then you will have to adjust this name in the pipeline run.
====

c. Add the following key/values to the secret:
+
[compact]
* `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`
* `AWS_DEFAULT_REGION`
* `AWS_S3_BUCKET`
* `AWS_S3_ENDPOINT`
* `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`
+
Use the same values that you have used to define the data connection in your RHODS project.
+
[NOTE]
====
After adding one key/value, click btn:[Add key/value] to add more.
====
Click btn:[Create].

d. From the developer perspective of the Red{nbsp}Hat OpenShift web console, click btn:[+Add].

e. In the btn:[From Local Machine] card, click btn:[Import YAML].

f. Paste the contents of the https://github.com/{github_user}/rhods-sound-classification/blob/main/apps/embedded/pipelines/pipeline.yaml file and click btn:[Create].
+
This YAML creates the pipeline that builds the container image for the CLI application.

g. Find the pipeline that you just created.
+
In the navigation pane, click btn:[Pipelines].
Verify that the page lists one pipeline.

h. Run the pipeline.
Click btn:[⋮], then click btn:[Start].
+
In the form that opens, select `VolumeClaimTemplate` as the btn:[shared-workspace].
If you previously created the S3 secrets with a name different from `s3-model-storage`, adjust the btn:[s3-secret] accordingly.
+
Click btn:[Start].
+
Wait for the pipeline to finish.
If the pipeline succeeds, then the container image of the CLI application should be available in the Red{nbsp}Hat OpenShift internal registry.
